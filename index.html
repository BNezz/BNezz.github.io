<h3> About Nezz's Family </h3>

<h3> What makes her happy </h3> 
    
<p> Inventing some dishes to cook is one of many reasons on what makes me happy. Another reason is to make lots of memories with my family and friends. 
    It also makes me happy when I am trying new and different things that is out of my comfort zone. Especially when I am afraid and hesitant to do it but did it instead, 
    it makes me happy since I dont have any regrets and I have lots of answers on my what if's. Also, it gives me lesson and courage and it lessen my fear in life. 
    Happiness is simple yet powerful, it is not out there, happiness is within us.
